;; TODO: integrate more fns and helpers from https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_6/schema-api.html


;; To use  Solr's implicit default behavior if no schemaFactory is explicitly defined. Add the following to your project solrconfig.xml file:
;; <schemaFactory class="ManagedIndexSchemaFactory">
;; <bool name="mutable">true</bool>
;; <str name="managedSchemaResourceName">managed-schema</str>
;; </schemaFactory>
;; Then create your project core/collection:
;; $SOLR_HOME/bin/solr start -e schemaless
;; copy files in $SOLR_HOME/example/schemaless/solr/gettingstarted/conf/
;; paste them in <your-clj-project>/resources/solr/conf/<core-name>
;; inside lang copied folder you can only keep _en file if you want, if so, then remove in "managed-schema" file, xml lines after ""some examples for different languages""
;; from your clojure project run:
;; $SOLR_HOME/bin/solr create -c <core-name> -d resources/solr/conf/<core-name>

;; The Managed Schema is supposed to be manipulated through the follwoing Schema API and not by editing the files present (which include a warning about doing so).

;; The schema.xml file (when not in schemaless mode) is only read once at the first time of startup to create the initial schema, any changes after that has to be done through the Schema API.

;; For data import handler like for atom, db (like sql), mail, solr, and tika:
;; $SOLR_HOME/bin/solr -e dih
;; for more info, see https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/uploading-structured-data-store-data-with-the-data-import-handler.html
