;;; Index Handler API

;; Index Handlers are Request Handlers designed to add, delete and update
;; documents to the index. In addition to having plugins for importing rich
;; documents using Tika or from structured data sources using the Data Import
;; Handler, Solr natively supports indexing structured documents with the
;; following API.

(defn update!
  "Sends JSON Update Command(s).
  In general, the JSON update syntax supports all of the update commands that
  the XML update handler supports, through a straightforward mapping. Multiple
  commands, adding and deleting documents, may be contained in one message.

  Usage:

  (update! client-config {:delete {:id \"id1\"}})

  (update! client-config {:add {:commitWithin 5000,
                                :overwrite false
                                :doc {:f1 \"v1\"
                                      :f2 \"v2\"}}})


  (update! client-config [{:add {:commitWithin 5000
                                          :overwrite false
                                          :doc {:f1 \"v1 \"
                                                :f2 \"v2 \"}}}
                                   {:delete {:id \"id1 \"}}])

(defn add!
  "Uploads 'doc-or-docs' (map or vector of maps) to solr using opened 'client'.
  Docs uploaded in pending status, do not auto commit unless mentioned in settings.
  Returns decoded response of service.

  Usage:

  (add! client-config {:id \"1\"  :title \"title 1\"})
  (add! client-config [{:id \"1\" :title \"title 1\"}
                       {:id \"2\" :title \"title 2\"}])

   [{:id \"1\" :title \"title 1\"}
    {:id \"2\" :title \"title 2\"}]
   {:commit true})

  Settings:

  :commit <bool>, default true
  The :commit operation writes all documents loaded since the last commit to
  one or more segment files on the disk. Before a commit has been issued,
  newly indexed content is not visible to searches. The commit operation opens
  a new searcher, and triggers any event listeners that have been configured.
  Commits may be triggered from <autocommit> parameters in solrconfig.xml.

  :commitWithin <int>
  Add the document within the specified number of milliseconds.

  :optimize <bool>
  The :optimize operation requests Solr to merge internal data structures in
  order to improve search performance. For a large index, optimization will
  take some time to complete, but by merging many small segment files into
  a larger one, search performance will improve. If you are using Solr’s
  replication mechanism to distribute searches across many systems, be aware
  that after an optimize, a complete index will need to be transferred.
  In contrast, post-commit transfers are usually much smaller.

  :overwrite <bool>, default: true
  Indicates if the unique key constraints should be checked to overwrite
  previous versions of the same document (see below).
